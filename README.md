# pr_queue
A "priority queue" where items are inserted into a queue with a defined priority, the highest priority items will be removed first. If items have the same priority then the item inserted first will be the first removed. It is an object-orientated programming exercise given to me for a piece of university coursework.
Hence, in details, create a PriorityQueue class with the following methods:
 _init_(self): constructor, initialises the Priority Queue.
 is_empty(self): returns True if the queue is empty, and False otherwise.
 clear(self): clear up the queue. That is, after calling this method, the queue will be
empty.
 insertInQueue(self; content; priority): inserts the element content into the Priority
Queue, with the corresponding priority given by priority.
 removeFromQueue(self) : removes the element of the queue with the highest pri-
ority, and returns it to the user.
